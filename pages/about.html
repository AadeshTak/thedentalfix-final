              <strong>The Dental Fix</strong> began as more than just a clinic. It started with
              <strong>two passionate dentists</strong>, <strong>one chair</strong>, and a shared belief that
              great dental care is built on <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>compassion</strong>, and
              <strong>genuine connection</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Dr. Ibrahim</strong> began his journey in <strong>Mumbai</strong>, traveling across the city as a
              specialist in
              <em>gum surgeries</em> and <em>dental implants</em>. His expertise soon extended to
              <strong>Gujarat</strong>, where he consulted at various clinics. A year later, he joined
              <strong>D.Y. Patil Dental School in Pune</strong> as a lecturer. While teaching during the day, he
              continued consulting at
              leading clinics in the evening, driven by his dedication to hands-on care.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the same time, <strong>Dr. Amreen</strong> was building her foundation at
              <strong>32 Smiles Dental Clinic</strong>, under the mentorship of <strong>Dr. Milind Darda</strong>,
              one of India's top <em>Invisalign providers</em>. Outside her main role, she served as a consulting
              <em>orthodontist</em> at multiple clinics, constantly sharpening her clinical skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              In <strong>2018</strong>, their personal and professional journeys aligned. On
              <strong>November 1st</strong>, they launched <strong>The Dental Fix</strong> with a single dental chair,
              a big dream, and a commitment to <strong>ethical and high-quality care</strong>. Long hours, late nights,
              and strong word-of-mouth helped them grow steadily, fueled by <strong>ongoing learning</strong> and
              <strong>genuine dedication</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The clinic expanded with <strong>new equipment</strong>, a <strong>second chair</strong>, and an
              increasing
              number of loyal patients who appreciated their warm, honest approach.
            </p>

            <p>
              In <strong>June 2021</strong>, they welcomed their daughter <strong>Aliza</strong>. Dr. Amreen practiced
              until just three days before delivery and returned to work within a month. During this time,
              Dr. Ibrahim balanced patient care and fatherhood, often caring for Aliza between appointments.
            </p>

            <p>
              On <strong>June 11, 2023</strong>, they opened <strong>The Dental Fix 2.0</strong>, a larger,
              state-of-the-art clinic with <strong>multiple dental chairs</strong>, <strong>advanced
                technology</strong>,
              and a relaxing, patient-first environment. Their team also grew, now including
              <strong>six skilled and compassionate doctors</strong> who carry forward the clinic's founding values.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, <strong>Dr. Amreen</strong> continues to serve as a consulting orthodontist while managing the
              clinic
              and embracing motherhood. <strong>Dr. Ibrahim</strong> remains hands-on, caring for patients and mentoring
              the team.
              Together, they are committed to the same mission they started with —
              to offer <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>expert</strong>, and <strong>empathetic dental care</strong>
              that truly makes patients feel valued.

                I have been visiting the Dental Fix clinic for the past one year and have been under the care of Dr
                Ibrahim for the dental issues which had been plaguing me for a considerable period of time. At the first
                visit itself Dr Ibrahim gave adequate time to listen to my concerns and explained my treatment options
                in a way that was easy for me to understand. He was also very transparent and upfront about the cost
                involved in the procedures which was very assuring. After nearly a year of extensive procedures, my
                dental health is now far better than it was a decade ago and I feel healthier than ever.
                The entire staff at the clinic is friendly, professional, and was always attentive to my needs. The
                procedures were performed with precision and care, and I left feeling confident in the quality of my
                dental work. I highly recommend Dr Ibrahim and the team at Dental Fix for anyone in need of dental care.

                experience. Both dentists exude humility and care, making me feel at ease throughout the treatment
                process. Their attention to detail and careful approach ensured that the treatment was not only
                effective but also result-oriented. I highly recommend their clinic for anyone seeking dental care with
                a personal touch."

                The ambience of the place is very warm and comfortable with great teamwork. The doctor is thoroughly
                professional, extremely composed and very approachable. He made me take a call in ten minutes of my
                first visit and briefed me about the procedure. This has, by far been one of my best decisions and I am
                extremely grateful for his wisdom towards my wisdom! Special thanks to Dr Yusra khatib for her
                excellence in diagnosis, procedure briefing and guidance!"
